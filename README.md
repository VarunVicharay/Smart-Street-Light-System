# Smart-Street-Light-System

Smart Street light is an automated system which automates the street light. The main aim of Smart Street Light System is to reduce the power consumption when there are no vehicle movements on the road. The Smart Street Light will glow with high intensity when there are vehicles on the road otherwise the lights will remain dim. With advancement of technology, things are becoming simpler and easier for everyone in the world today.

I created this project using Arduino UNO, IR Sensor, LDR, LED.
